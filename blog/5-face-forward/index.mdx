This wednesday, Telenor launched their new strategy called "Face Forward". The
strategy outlines Telenor's vision and direction for the coming years, focusing
on key areas for the next phase of Telenor's development.

During the event, Nova hosted a booth where we showcased our cloud platform. To
make things more fun, we created a game for the occasion called "Legacy
Terminator 3000", which visitors could try out right there at our stand.

The idea of the game was to build a space ship using blocks. The ship needs engines,
shields and weapons to be able to fly through space to destroy legacy systems and
protect Telenor from evil corporate bureaucrats.

The game was developed using vibe coding by our super talented Lead Architect Sindre
(@sindrel). Vibe coding is a way of rapidly developing software using AI agents
to help with coding tasks. Sindre used GPT-5? to help with generating code
snippets, images and integrations. The game itself was built in JavaScript
running in the browser with a backend in Python. The game was built in a few
days, and was a fun way to showcase Nova.

In total, around 150 games were played during the event, with a lot of engagement and
fun.

The winner of the game got a special prize consisting of a space ship LEGO set!
Congratulations to the winner!
