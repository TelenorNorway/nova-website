This week we in Cloud Platforms (Telenor Norway) hosted the [Offentlig PaaS
community meetup at Fornebu](https://offentlig-paas.no/fagdag/2025-10-15-selvbetjening-fagdag),
within Telenor’s campus. Offentlig PaaS is a network for technologists in
public sector in Norway, that focuses on whose who build and operate digital
services, with large focus on platforms, application, architecture and security.
It was started by NAV and Skatteetaten in 2017, and has grown over the years to
become a large and active community, with almost 3000 members, that comes
together and share and help each other to solve problems.

The theme of this week’s meetup was self-service, with topics covering both the
technical and the non-technical aspects that are essential to understand when
working on self-service within the cloud space. At Cloud Platforms, we’ve
adopted a platform-as-a-product approach, prioritizing customer feedback and
understanding their needs. Our goal is not only to empower users to provision
capabilities independently but also to identify which capabilities deliver the
most value. This customer-centric mindset remains central to Nova’s ongoing
development.

Other than Telenor, we had representatives from NAV, Vy and Kartverket to talk
about what they were doing within this space. NAV showed off their NAIS
platform, and how they have taken the steps over the last years, to where they
are today with a full-fledged front end that their customers can use to
self-serve themselves within their platform. Vy talk focused around their
perspective into product development and how this have helped them in their
self-service journey, and Kartverket showed off how they used self-service
within their data platform, and their journey going from a lot of systems with a
lot of data spread around, to figuring out who the customer is and how they have
made their data available through self-service. Really inspiring talks by
everyone, offering a lot of insight and will be a great inspiration for us in
Cloud Platforms as we continue to advance with our self-service journey.

The turnout of the meetup was great, with almost 100 attendance that was in
place in Fornebu, and around 50 online throughout the day.

Thanks everyone for joining and sharing, and great to chat and meet you all!
