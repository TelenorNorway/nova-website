We're incredibly proud to share that one of our own security researchers was
recently featured on the official GitHub Blog in their post "Top security
researcher shares their bug bounty process".

And here's the coolest part - all of this work was done entirely in his own free
time, driven purely by curiosity and passion for security research. No
assignments, just genuine interest and skill shining through.

His approach and findings impressed GitHub's security team enough to be
showcased globally, and we couldn't be happier to see his talent recognized on
the big stage.

André ([@dev-bio](https://github.com/dev-bio)) is a core member of the Cloud
Security team in Cloud Platforms, where he helps secure our platform and builds
new security capabilities for our users. We consider him one of the leading
security researchers in Norway, and we're genuinely so lucky to have him on the
team.
