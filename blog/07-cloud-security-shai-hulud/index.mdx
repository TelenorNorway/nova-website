One of the responsibilities for our cloud security team is to provide a secure
supply chain for all developers on the platform. Our work is inspired by
Google’s Shared Fate model, and we’ve kept an eye on the recent development of
compromised npm packages, including the previous ‘Shai-Hulud’ campaign.

We were notified of the campaign early through a security company’s
notification, and based on our immediate observations, we decided to act fast.

Our Initial Response
This wasn’t our first rodeo. Based on recent npm package compromises, we were
prepared. Our initial response focused on gaining an overview of the campaign
to understand exactly what we were up against.

We quickly learned that it spread through what was likely self-propagating
malware. Seeing the GitHub repositories that were spreading secrets grow by
more than a thousand per hour, we were confident this attack was ongoing, and
time was of the essence.

Through various vendor blog posts and by engaging with the community in the
[Cloud Security Forum Slack](https://fwdcloudsec.org/forum/), we gained a 
list of packages we knew were compromised and developed a stronger
awareness of the ongoing campaign.

## Reverse Engineering the Malware
Using one of the compromised packages, we were able to download a sample of the
malware that had been uploaded to npm. At this stage, there were no solid
reports of what the malware was capable of. Since it was obfuscated, our
initial response was to extract indicators (unique file hashes consistent
across all packages) and initiate our process to de-obfuscate the malware.

We gradually learned more about the malware and its capability to harvest
additional secrets, making us aware of the potential blast radius and TTPs to
look for in the cloud environment and on workstations.

Our coordinated response with the rest of Telenor’s security organization led
to this incident having no impact on Telenor’s cloud platform.
