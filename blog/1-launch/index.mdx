Hi from the Cloud Platforms team in Telenor!

We've been hard at work for many years building the platform that powers
Telenor's cloud services.

During a (luckily) quite uneventful summer, our team managed to squeeze in
some time to work on an idea that has been on our minds for a while: the
launch of our new public website!

This website is a significant milestone for us, as it represents a new chapter
in our journey. Going forward we in the Cloud Platforms value stream will be
sharing more updates, news, and insights, straight from our team to you.

We also created a few pages to help you get to know us better:
- [A page showcasing some of our features](/features) in case you want to
  explore what our platform has to offer.
- [A contact page](/contact) if you want to get in touch with us.

Stay tuned for more updates from us in the coming months!

P.S. We support RSS feeds, so if you use an RSS reader, you can
subscribe to our blog feed at `/rss.xml`.
