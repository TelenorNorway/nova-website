This October, Telenor had the pleasure of attending [Cloud Native Bergen
2025](https://2025.cloudnativebergen.dev/), a fantastic event that brought
together cloud enthusiasts and professionals from Norway and beyond. The
conference was held in the beautiful city of Bergen, offering a perfect backdrop
for a gathering focused on the latest innovations in cloud computing.

The conference was packed with insightful talks and workshops. Some of our 
favorite sessions included:
- [Hack din egen pipeline (før andre gjør det)](https://2025.cloudnativebergen.dev/speaker/emil-albrektsson)
  by Emil Albrektsson and Jan-Kåre Solbakken from Nav, who let us hack
  our own CI/CD pipelines in a fun and interactive way.
- [A Technical Review of Crossplane v2.0](https://2025.cloudnativebergen.dev/speaker/steven-borrelli)
  by Steven Borrelli from Upbound, providing deep insights into the new features
  and improvements in Crossplane v2.0.
- [From Paper to Practice: Implementing NIST Cloud Security Guidance](https://2025.cloudnativebergen.dev/speaker/matt-turner)
  by Matt Turner from Tetrate, which offered practical advice on applying NIST
  guidelines in real-world cloud environments.
- [Building a Sovereign Cloud: What are we missing to solve Norways digital future?](https://2025.cloudnativebergen.dev/speaker/jan-ivar-beddari)
  by Jan Ivar Beddari from Safespring, discussing the key challenges and opportunities
  in creating a sovereign cloud infrastructure in Norway.

This year, Telenor was also proud to speak at the event, sharing insights and
experiences from our journey with setting up and operating our cloud platform,
Nova, for Telenor Denmark. Our talk delved into the challenges we faced and how
we were able to overcome them with only 2 people in the team, highlighting the
importance of automation, scalability, and a customer-centric approach in building
a successful cloud platform.

The talk will be made available on YouTube soon, so stay tuned for that!
