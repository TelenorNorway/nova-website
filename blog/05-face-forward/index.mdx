This wednesday, Telenor launched their new strategy called "Face Forward". The
strategy outlines Telenor's vision and direction for the coming years, focusing
on key areas for the next phase of Telenor's development.

During the event, Nova hosted a booth where we showcased our cloud platform. To
make things more fun, we created a game for the occasion called "Legacy
Terminator 3000", which visitors could try out right there at our stand.

The idea of the game was to build a space ship using blocks. The ship needs engines,
shields and weapons to be able to fly through space to destroy legacy systems and
protect Telenor from evil corporate bureaucrats. The more legacy systems you
destroy, the higher score you get, so we had a leaderboard to display the top
scores on a separate computer. This meant syncing scores between the game and the
leaderboard in real-time, which was a fun technical challenge.

The game was developed from scratch using vibe coding by our super talented Lead
Architect Sindre Lindstad. Vibe coding is a way of rapidly developing software
using AI agents to help with coding tasks. Sindre used Claude Sonnet 4.5 to help
with generating code snippets, images and integrations. The game itself was
built in JavaScript running in the browser with a backend in Python. The game
was built in a few days, and was a fun way to showcase Nova.

In total, around 150 games were played during the event, with a lot of engagement and
good discussions.

The winner of the game got a special prize consisting of a space ship LEGO set!
Congratulations to the winner!
