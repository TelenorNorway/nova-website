Most of us have a busy schedule at work and at home, and therefore it isn't always easy
to get time to work on a dream project or just learn something new. All of us
find ourselves in different life situations, and not everyone has the
possibility to spend their spare time to do so.

To help with getting room in the workday to work on something that you are
personally passionate about, we created Innovation days. It is two consecutive
days where you can work on whatever you find interesting. Yes, two whole days
to work with almost anything you feel like!

So what's the goal with this? First of all, our ambition with Innovation days is
that you learn something new, and maybe meet people that you do not work with on
a regular basis. So therefore it's both social and a learning experience. 

Ahead of the innovation days, everyone sends in a short description of the
project they want to work on. Then before the innovation days start, we do a
presentation meeting, where everyone shares their ideas. Then others can join
any of the ideas that are presented, so that on the Innovation days, they can
group up and work together. We do not set any requirements regarding the idea;
the important part is that you get inspired, learn something new, and maybe
connect with someone that you have never talked to before.

After the innovation days are done, every initiative is then presented and
demonstrated to everyone on a big screen. If we see that there are some ideas
that stick out, we then will give it more time. This we do through the already
established teams that we have working in Cloud Platforms.

We have already run several innovation days with great success, so this is
something that we see creates great value for everyone involved.

PS! We also serve cake in the demo meetings! üç∞
