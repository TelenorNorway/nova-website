GitOps is an approach that manages both your application code and
infrastructure configurations via a single Git repository. This gives
you a “single source of truth” ensuring that every change, whether it’s
a new feature or a tweak to your infrastructure, goes through the same
version-controlled, automated process.

This gives a few great benefits:

1.  **Visibility & Traceability**: Every modification is tracked in Git.
    No more hunting for who changed what or running manual scripts at 2
    AM.
2.  **Faster Rollbacks**: If something breaks, it takes just a few
    clicks to revert to a previous working state.
3.  **Streamlined Collaboration**: Developers and operations teams work
    in one shared framework, reducing handoffs and friction.
4.  **Security by Design**: Using Git as the central hub means all
    changes are reviewed and approved before they ever touch production,
    improving auditability and compliance.
