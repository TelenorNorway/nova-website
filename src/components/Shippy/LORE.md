# Shippy the dog

Shippy is a playful dog who used to be a radio DJ on the radio channel K9. One
day she thought "there has to be lots of fun things to do than playing music all
day!". She decided to find out what else was out there, and after meeting a
fluffy cloud she started exploring the world of containers and microservices.
Shippy is now a happy dog who loves to help developers by providing a simple way
to deploy and manage their applications.
