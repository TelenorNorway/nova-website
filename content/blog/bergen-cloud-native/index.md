In the ever-evolving world of Kubernetes, managing deployments can be a complex
and time-consuming task. Enter Argo CD, a declarative, GitOps continuous
delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD simplifies and automates the deployment
process, ensuring that your applications are always in sync with your desired
state as defined in your Git repositories.

Eline spoke at the Cloud Native Bergen conference about the future of cloud
native technologies and how the Nova platform team uses GitOps.

She shared the apps repositories pattern, which enables self service for
developers and a clear separation of concerns between the platform team and the
application teams.
